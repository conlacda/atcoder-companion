/**
 * First, just calculated rating for algorithm contest
 * If have time, implement for heuristic as well
 * 
 * TODO:
 * If contest was over, use API to show rating + performance
 * If contest is running, 
 *  1. crawl user competition history - ignore the difference of P & RP for top (just 1%, so after some contests it will get right)
 *      After each new contest, we will calculate the real performance. 
 *      or get APerf from atcoder predictor (tricky)
 * 2. use formular to calculate
